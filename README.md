## Expat Nuget Package

This project builds an Expat Nuget package with static Expat
libraries and header files  for the `x64` platform, built
with Visual C++ 2022, against Debug/Release MT/DLL MSVC CRT.

Visit Expat website for additional information about the Expat
project and library documentation:

https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat

## Package Configuration

The Expat static libraries from this package will appear within
the installation target project after the package is installed.
The solution may need to be reloaded to make libraries visible.
Both, debug and release libraries will be listed in the project,
but only the one appropriate for the currently selected
configuration will be included in the build. These libraries
may be moved into solution folders after the installation (e.g.
`lib/Debug` and `lib/Release`).

Note that the Expat library path in this package will be selected
as `Debug` or `Release` based on whether the selected configuration
is designated as a development or as a release configuration via
the standard Visual Studio property called `UseDebugLibraries`.
Additional configurations copied from the standard ones will
inherit this property. 

Do not install this package if your projects use debug configurations
without `UseDebugLibraries`. Note that CMake-generated Visual Studio
projects will not emit this property.

Expat libraries in this package are built with narrow character
support only and cannot parse XML documents maintained as wide
character strings.

See `StoneSteps.Expat.VS2022.Static.props` and
`StoneSteps.Expat.VS2022.Static.targets`
for specific package configuration details and file locations.

## Building a Nuget Package

This project can build a Nuget package for Expat either locally
or via a GitHub workflow. In each case, following steps are taken.

  * Expat source archive is downloaded from Expat's website and
    its SHA-256 signature is verified.

  * VS2022 Community Edition is used to build Expat libraries
    locally and Enterprise Edition to build libraries on GitHub.

  * Build artifacts for all platforms and configurations are
    collected in staging directories under `nuget/build/native/lib`.

  * `nuget.exe` is used to package staged files with the first
    three version components used as an Expat version and the last
    version component used as a package revision. See _Package
    Version_ section for more details.

  * The Nuget package built on GitHub is uploaded to [nuget.org][].
    The package built locally is saved in the root project
    directory.

## Package Version

### Package Revision

Nuget packages lack package revision and in order to repackage
the same upstream software version, such as Expat v2.5.0, the
4th component of the Nuget version is used to track the Nuget
package revision.

Nuget package revision is injected outside of the Nuget package
configuration, during the package build process, and is not present
in the package specification file.

Specifically, `nuget.exe` is invoked with `-Version=0.6.24.123`
to build a package with the revision `123`.

### Version Locations

Expat version is located in a few places in this repository and
needs to be changed in all of them for a new version of Expat.

  * nuget/StoneSteps.Expat.VS2022.Static.nuspec (`version`)
  * devops/make-package.bat (`PKG_VER`, `PKG_REV`, `EXPAT_FNAME`,
    `EXPAT_RNAME`, `EXPAT_SHA256`)
  * .github/workflows/build-nuget-package.yml (`name`, `PKG_VER`,
    `PKG_REV`, `EXPAT_FNAME`, `EXPAT_RNAME`, `EXPAT_SHA256`)

`EXPAT_SHA256` ia a SHA-256 checksum of the Expat package file and
needs to be changed when a new version of Expat is released.

In the GitHub workflow YAML, `PKG_REV` must be reset to `1` (one)
every time Expat version is changed. The workflow file must be
renamed with the new version in the name. This is necessary because
GitHub maintains build numbers per workflow file name.

For local builds package revision is supplied on the command line
and should be specified as `1` (one) for a new version of Expat.

### GitHub Build Number

Build number within the GitHub workflow YAML is maintained in an
unconventional way because of the lack of build maturity management
between GitHub and Nuget.

For example, using build management systems, such as Artifactory,
every build would generate a Nuget package with the same version
and package revision for the upcoming release and build numbers
would be tracked within the build management system. A build that
was successfully tested would be promoted to the production Nuget
repository without generating a new build.

Without a build management system, the GitHub workflow in this
repository uses the pre-release version as a surrogate build
number for builds that do not publish packages to nuget.org,
so these builds can be downloaded and tested before the final
build is made and published to nuget.org. This approach is not
recommended for robust production environments because even
though the final published package is built from the exact
same source, the build process may still potentially introduce 
some unknowns into the final package (e.g. build VM was updated).

## Building Package Locally

You can build a Nuget package locally with `make-package.bat`
located in `devops`. This script expects VS2022 Community Edition
installed in the default location. If you have other edition of
Visual Studio, edit the file to use the correct path to the
`vcvarsall.bat` file.

Run `make-package.bat` from the repository root directory with a
package revision as the first argument. There is no provision to
manage build numbers from the command line and other tools should
be used for this (e.g. Artifactory).

## Sample Application

A Visual Studio project is included in this repository under
`sample-expat` to test the Nuget package built by this project.
This application prints elements and their attributes of a
hard-coded XML string.

In order to build `sample-expat.exe`, open Nuget Package manager
in the solution and install either the locally-built Nuget package
or the one from [nuget.org][].
